# Cache_Simulation
This project is a **C-based** simulation of cache memory operations. It mimics how a CPU cache interacts with main memory, handling cache hits, misses, write-through, and write-allocate policies, along with **LFU** (Least Frequently Used) replacement. Users provide the main memory size, initial data, and cache configuration (set index bits, tag bits, block offset bits, and associativity), after which the simulation processes memory accesses. 
The program uses standard C libraries (stdio, stdlib, string) and dynamic memory allocation, and it is built using a **Makefile.**
